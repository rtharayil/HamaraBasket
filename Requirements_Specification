Hi and welcome to team HamaraBasket.com . As you know, we are a small online retail shop, 
we buy from local sources and sell you the best products. 
One of our systems is our Quality rule engine which helps us in making informed decisions about pricing and discounts . 
Currently we need help in adding a new requirement   ,
we have observed that lots of fruits and vegetables are rotting off very fast as we are not focusing on clearing the inventory on time . 
We have decided that “Fresh fruits and Vegetables” needs to have a different quality rule. Please help us  in implementing  this change .
New Req
            - " Fresh fruits and Vegetables” degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items


Current behaviour 

            - All items have a SellBy value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item
            - All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
            - At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item

Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:

            - Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
            - The Quality of an item is never negative
            - "Indian Wine" actually increases in Quality the older it gets
            - The Quality of an item is never more than 50
            - "Forest Honey", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
            - "Movie Tickets ", like Indian Wine, increases in Quality as its SellBy value approaches;
            Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but
            Quality drops to 0 after the Show.
